I worked with a small team of UX designers tasked with re-designing the experience of Inforâ€™s Order Collaboration tool. We decided to take a step by step approach in an effort to prove our solution was technically feasible. The end results was a final prototype that could be used for user testing and ultimately implementation by our product team. The key challenge for me was to create these examples without the use of any 3rd party libraries.

##Step 1 // Sticky column
This simple first step was an effort to show how a sticky column could be implemented with table based markup.

##Step 2 // Expanding + sticky rows
Next, I needed to combined expandable rows with sticky rows.

##Step 3 // Expanding + sticky rows &amp; columns
After successfully combining expandable rows and sticky rows it was time to add the sticky side column back in.

##Step 4 // Final Prototype
And lastly, I needed to create the final prototype which included several other interactions.
